üõë Agent as a Service - Stop Services Script

USAGE:
    pwsh stop-services.ps1

DESCRIPTION:
    This script stops all running Agent as a Service processes:
    1. Reads process IDs from .running-services.json
    2. Stops OrchestratorService and OrchestratorWebApp
    3. Cleans up any remaining processes on ports 8080 and 5264
