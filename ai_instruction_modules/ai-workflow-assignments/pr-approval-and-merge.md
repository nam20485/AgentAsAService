# Assignment: Pull Request (PR) Approval and Merge

## (pr-approval-and-merge)

### Goal

Resolve all PR comments and get the PR approved

### Acceptance Criteria

1. All PR comments resolved.
2. PR approved.
3. Branch merged upstream.
4. Issue closed.

### Assignment

In this stage your assignment will be to iterate on the PR comments until they
are all resolved and the PR is approved. Once PR comments are available
you will work systematically to resolve each comment, one after another,

### Detailed Steps

1. For each unresolved comment, review the comment:

1. If you have already submitted a reply with a plan, then you must wait
 for the stake holder to review your plan and approve it before you can implement the changes.
1. Move on to the next comment.

1. If you have not yet submitted a reply, then you will need to review the comment and the entire context of this comment.
1. This includes:
1. All the replies in this comment's thread
1. The PR's original code changes
1. Any code changes or plans resulting from previous iterations on this comment.
1. Have you already submitted any plans that were rejected?
1. At this point, go read the issue and PR again
1. Given the context determine the options to resolve the comment.
1. If it's trivial, there is only one option, and requires no input, then make the code change(s) and update the reply with
   a short explanation.
    1. If there are multiple options, or only one but its not trivial, is risky, and/or requires further input then leave a reply explaining the plan, or different options.
    1. If you have a recommendation, then state so and why.
    1. Ask for approval, direction, or other required input/feedback to proceed.
    1. Move on the next comment.
    1. If you are unsure how to proceed, then ask for help in the chat or reply.
1. If the stake-holder reply contains approval for a previously submitted plan, then you will be able to implement the changes now.
1. If the stake-holder reply contains a request for changes, then you will need to review the comment and ensure that you understand the feedback provided.
1. Address the feedback and update your implementation accordingly.
1. **After implementing each approved plan, leave a comment reply to the preceding approval comment informing stakeholders that you have completed implementing the indicated plan. Include details of what was changed and confirm the implementation status.**
1. Communicate your changes and seek further clarification if needed.

* Iterate in this manner until all comments and replies have been addressed.
* Once all PR comments have been resolved, the stake-holder will approve the PR.

### Completion

Ask the stake-holder if they want you to merge the PR or if they would like to do so themselves.
If so, then merge the PR, and close the issue and branch.
Eat a cookie and have an espresso or a milkshake. You can have both if you want.
Ask the stake-holder for your next assignment.
